# QuantumComputing-Architecture

Quantum computers have achieved a solid base
in both physics and mathematics. Many people believe that a
quantum computer is like a classical computer â€“ once you have
seen one, you have seen them all, and they all give the same
results. Maybe someday all quantum computers will work the
same way but not today. Unlike classical computers where the
bits have a similar relationship between individual computers, the
quantum bits (qubits) of a quantum computer are connected in
many different patterns. Reviewing the architecture of quantum
computers used in the IBM Quantum Experience shows the
variety of ways that the qubits are connected to each other. This
study used the superdense coding algorithm to show that different
quantum computing architects affect the resulting probabilistic
outputs.
